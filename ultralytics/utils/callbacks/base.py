    Get the default callbacks for Ultralytics training, validation, prediction, and export processes.

            event during the training process, and the corresponding value is a list of callback functions that are
            executed when that event occurs.

    Examples:

    Add integration callbacks to the instance's callbacks dictionary.

    This function loads and adds various integration callbacks to the provided instance. The specific callbacks added
    depend on the type of instance provided. All instances receive HUB callbacks, while Trainer instances also receive
    additional callbacks for various integrations like ClearML, Comet, DVC, MLflow, Neptune, Ray Tune, TensorBoard,
    and Weights & Biases.

    Args:
        instance (Trainer | Predictor | Validator | Exporter): The object instance to which callbacks will be added.
            The type of instance determines which callbacks are loaded.

    Examples:
        >>> from ultralytics.engine.trainer import BaseTrainer
        >>> trainer = BaseTrainer()
